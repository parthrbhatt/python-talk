## Everything is an object

- Strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are objects.
- Everything has attributes and methods:
 - types have member functions.
 - functions have attributes.
 - modules can be passed as arguments, etc.
- To checkout what's contained inside _anything_ use dir()
